As the global pandemic rages on, the University continues to face the challenge of offering courses to students scattered around the globeworld. After spring 2020, the University began a number of initiatives to accommodate students studying from international time zones. However, many have raised questions about the effectiveness and sincerity of these efforts."

Because the survey was released with the aim of providing feedback to Barnard when “planning for the spring 2021 semester,” international students felt that this was one of the ways the College was trying to accommodate students of all time zones. However, for Katya Reichert, a Barnard first-yearfreshman who spent the fall semester studying from the Philippines, the scheduled times of the top two courses that she indicated—Introduction to Art History II and Data Structures in Java—remained the same. “I don’t know if it was performative, or if not enough people chose the classes that I chose,” Reichert speculates on why the Barnard survey seemed to have made no change."

Back in August 2020, the Center for the Core Curriculum gave all students who were enrolled in Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and/or Music Humanities the opportunity to petition for a new section if their current section met between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. in their local time zone. However, when Columbia College sophomore Kevin Sun Park requested to switch out of his Contemporary Civilization section that was scheduled for 4 a.m. in Seoul, his petition was rejected by the Core Office."

Not all professors, however, have shown the same level of compassion towards students abroad."

He was trying so hard for us to feel like we’re still in the community and communicating with real people. It’s really disappointing to see that other professors are not doing the same.”"
