At the end of the fall 2020 semester, Barnard surveyed its students on which classes they intended to take in the upcoming spring semester and how important those classes were to them. Because the survey was released with the aim of providing feedback to Barnard when planning for the spring 2021 semester, many international students expected the college to accommodate their living in different time zones. However, for Katya Reichert, a Barnard first-year who spent the fall semester studying from the Philippines, the scheduled times of the top two courses that she indicated—Introduction to Art History II and Data Structures in Java—remained the same. “I don’t know if [the survey] was performative, or if not enough people chose the classes that I chose,” Reichert said."

However, when Columbia College sophomore Kevin Sun Park requested to switch out of his Contemporary Civilization section that was scheduled for 4 a.m. in Seoul, his petition was rejected by the Core Office."
